# LMH
The basis for this app was some proof-of-concept Java written to log into the intranet. The app was then developed around this to see how much could easily be done with this and with quite a lot of success. A reasonable amount of the code still shows signs of this but as the app relies mostly on scraping specific web pages, is only used by a few people who won't be at LMH that much longer and works reasonably well, there isn't much incentive to make it less of hack.
